# Investment-Portfolio-Optimization
Project Name: Investment Portfolio Optimization Using Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics

# Project Description:
This project focuses on optimizing an investment portfolio by forecasting stock prices and minimizing risk using advanced analytics. It applies descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to five prominent stocksâ€”Amazon, AMD, Cisco, Netflix, and Apple. The goal is to allocate investments strategically to achieve a target return of 5% while minimizing risk. The project involves:

    Descriptive Analytics: Historical stock trend analysis, summary statistics, and data visualization.
    Predictive Analytics: Forecasting stock prices using the AutoReg model and evaluating model performance with error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE).
    Prescriptive Analytics: Portfolio optimization using mathematical modeling, correlation and covariance analysis, and investment weight allocation to balance risk and return.
